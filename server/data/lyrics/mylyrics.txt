When everything's changed
I stayed the same
If I be a player
I played the game
Can't blame you
I'm to blame
Wrong timing
Guess it's just a shame

But sometimes that's just life
It feel wrong but it be right
In my arms outta sight
In my dreams outta life

Guess I'll just dream every night
That's when I feel I'm alive
Cause a life without you
Would never feel like it's right
La la la la la la

But what can I do
If I'm falling for you
I guess that I can pray
That I'll get over you (I won't get over you)

I'm whylin whylin
Cause I'm on you

I'm tryin trying
Tryna get over you

I'm lying lying
I won't get over you

Something bout u darling
Damm you hella special

Your flaws
Work of art
Can't stop
But I'll start
Your here
But your far
Your close
But your not

Something bout you make you easy to remember
I know it's far away but I can wait forever

It's hard
They say follow your mind
But my heart
It's easy to find
It's where you are

Something bout you make you easy to remember
I know it's far away but I can wait forever
Maybe I'm dreaming and wel never be together
So I'll keep dreaming cause this life feels so much better

I'm whylin whylin
Cause I'm on you

I'm tryin trying
Tryna get over you

I'm lying lying
I won't get over you

Something bout u darling
Damm you hella special
